## Abstract
Education is the backbone and significant factor in the development of a better future. The research on factors affecting performance of student’s academic achievements are very crucial for educational institutions and government to make decisions on quality education. The main purpose of this study is to analyse the student’s performance by using inferential statistical and RStudio to calculate and display the hypothesis. As per statistical reports, the main areas have been taken into account include on factors influencing academic performance are parents’ background, race or ethnicity, test preparation and gender on students’ academic performance. Conclusion has been made that nature and nurture works best together.

## Introduction
According to Cattell’s theory (1963, 1987) intelligence is characterized by two fundamentals concepts namely – General Fluid Intelligence and General Crystallized Intelligence. The former includes skills that are not taught or learned through education, whereas the latter is manifested through accumulated knowledge and the ability to think logically using concepts that have been learned. Genetics does contribute to intelligence but works at least in part by a genetic influence on the environments. This means that a genetic basis for intelligence is as much about one’s nurture as about one’s nature. One who studies and prepares well before examination, overloading himself with unbearable pressure may score worse than one who did not prepare; one with a less educated parents maybe as good as or better than one’s with highly educated parents. 

“Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.” – Thomas Edison. Hence, excellence academic performance can be achieved with enough diligence and determination in practicing. However, some factors such as race, ethnicity and social class is a persistent reality that defines the way one approaches life. Very often people from a lower income family or rural areas have not been through higher education. Such family likely have had the opportunity to be exposed to many books or languages. This can be clearly seen in Malaysia where one should master Bahasa Malaysia and English fluently to have a well-paid job. Undeniably, one who is trilingual with an additional Mandarin speaking skills will be more privileged in the working society.

Juxtapose, nurture or nature; which contributes more on students’ academic performance? Nature of inheritance - gender, race, parents’ education level or nurture of test preparation done on writing score, reading score, math score and average score.

## Methodology

Secondary data “StudentPerformance.csv” is obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/student-performance-analysis/data). The targeted population is the students of a public school in Utah, United States. The collected data involves a sample of 1000 students from different family backgrounds. Variables such as gender, test preparation course, parental level of education, math score, reading score, writing score are identified. Inferential statistics are carried out by using hypothesis testing two sample, correlation, regression, Chi-Square test of independence and ANOVA.
